Device Configuration Management
A Python script can be used to log in to multiple network devices, retrieve their configurations, and compare them to a predefined standard to ensure consistency.

Network Inventory Collection
Python can automate gathering device information such as IP addresses, serial numbers, and software versions from all devices on the network, storing it in a centralized database or CSV file.

Automated Backup of Configurations
Scripts can connect to devices like switches, routers, or firewalls, download their current configurations, and save them as backups in a secure location.

Dynamic VLAN Management
A script can be designed to update VLAN configurations dynamically on switches, such as creating new VLANs or updating access and trunk port assignments.

Real-Time Network Monitoring
Python can be scripted to poll devices via SNMP or APIs to gather metrics like bandwidth usage, latency, or error counts and generate alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

Software Upgrade Automation
A script can upload new firmware or software updates to devices and trigger an automated reboot sequence, ensuring all devices are running the latest version.

Policy Compliance Auditing
Scripts can verify whether network devices comply with security policies, such as ensuring SSH is enabled, or checking that outdated protocols like Telnet are disabled.

Network Troubleshooting
Python can be used to automate common troubleshooting tasks, like pinging multiple devices, tracing routes, or checking the status of specific interfaces.

Access Control Updates
Automate the addition or removal of entries in access control lists (ACLs) or firewalls to ensure that access permissions are updated quickly and without manual error.

Network Topology Visualization
Using data from APIs or network discovery protocols, a script can generate a network topology map that shows device interconnections and link statuses.
